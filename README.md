interview-detect-jquery
=======================

Create a full stack application that will send the server a URL and the server will return whether or not that site uses jquery. 

The Problem
===========
Create an HTML form that submits a URL from a text input to the server via AJAX. The server should then determine what version(s) of jQuery the site at that URL uses, if any. The client should then display the version(s) to the user, or a message saying "jQuery is not used at this site".
