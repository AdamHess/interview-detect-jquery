To get the application running you must have:
1) Nodejs installed
2) phantomjs installed globally with npm instal phantomjs -g  (or added to your path if you do not have root access)
3) run "npm install" to load all the server dependancies 
4) in the ./app directory run bower install to load fronend dependancies (or can manually configure it for loading jQuery)



once everything is installed run

nodejs main.js 

then in your browser access

localhost 

and it should be ready to go
